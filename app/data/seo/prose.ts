    faq: [
      { question: "How many technical skills should I list on my {jobTitle} resume?", answer: "Focus on 8-12 core technical skills that directly match the job posting. It's better to deeply demonstrate fewer skills with concrete examples than to list every technology you've touched. Prioritize the skills mentioned in the job description and those you can speak to confidently in an interview." },
      { question: "Should I include technologies I've only used briefly?", answer: "Only include technologies you could discuss in an interview. If you've completed a significant project or used it professionally for at least a few months, include it. For brief exposure, consider a 'Familiar With' section separate from your core skills, or leave it off entirely." },
      { question: "How do I show impact when my work was part of a larger team?", answer: "Use specific language about your individual contribution: 'Led the implementation of...' or 'Owned the {technicalSkills[0]} component that...' Then connect it to team outcomes. Interviewers understand software is collaborative. They want to know what *you* specifically did." },
      { question: "What if I don't have metrics for my engineering work?", answer: "Estimate reasonable metrics or use qualitative impact: 'Reduced page load time from 3s to under 1s' or 'Eliminated manual deployment process used by 15-person team.' You can also describe scale (requests/second, data volume, team size) or business outcomes (shipped feature used by X customers)." },
      { question: "How do I handle gaps between my skills and the job requirements?", answer: "Apply if you meet 60-70% of requirements since job postings often describe ideal candidates. Address gaps honestly: highlight transferable skills, show learning ability through past examples, and mention any self-study or side projects in relevant areas. Don't claim skills you don't have." }

If you've used {tools.slice(0,3).join(\", \")}, name them in context and connect them to deliverables: dashboards, ETL jobs, experiment readouts, stakeholder reports. Tool keywords are often hard filters in analytics hiring.",

    faq: [
      { question: "How do I demonstrate SQL skills on my {jobTitle} resume?", answer: "Go beyond 'proficient in SQL.' Describe the complexity: 'Wrote complex queries joining 10+ tables across 50M+ row datasets' or 'Built reusable CTEs for cohort analysis used by 5 analysts.' Mention specific techniques (window functions, query optimization) and the business outcomes they enabled." },
      { question: "Should I include personal projects or Kaggle competitions?", answer: "Yes, especially if you're early in your career or transitioning into data. Frame them professionally: describe the problem, your approach, and results. A well-documented GitHub project with clean code and clear insights can demonstrate skills as effectively as work experience." },
      { question: "How do I show business impact when I only built reports?", answer: "Reports enable decisions, so trace the impact downstream. 'Built weekly retention dashboard that identified 15% drop-off point, leading to product fix that improved retention by 8%.' Even if you didn't make the decision, show that your analysis informed it." },
      { question: "What's the difference between a Data Analyst and Data Scientist resume?", answer: "Data Analyst resumes emphasize SQL, BI tools, dashboards, and business metric definition. Data Scientist resumes emphasize Python/R, statistical modeling, ML, and experimentation. If you're targeting both, create separate versions that emphasize the relevant skills and outcomes for each." },
      { question: "How technical should my {jobTitle} resume be?", answer: "Match the job posting. Some roles want deep technical detail (modeling techniques, tools, query complexity); others want business outcomes with light technical context. Read the posting carefully. If it emphasizes 'stakeholder communication' more than specific tools, lean toward impact over technical depth." }

  "Product & Design": {
    intro: "Product and design hiring teams scan for two things fast: how you make decisions and what changed because of them. Your keywords should reflect the lifecycle (discovery, prioritization, delivery, and measurement) so ATS can match you and humans can trust you. Use the sections below to surface the methods, tools, and outcomes you've actually shipped.",
    technicalSkillsContext: "Technical skills are the \"must-haves\" that often drive initial screening for {jobTitle} roles.

    toolsContext: "Tools and technologies help employers quickly picture your day-to-day workflow in {jobTitle}. If you've used {tools.slice(0,3).join(\", \")}, name them in context and connect each to an artifact (PRD, roadmap, prototype, research synthesis, experiment readout) so it reads like evidence, not name-dropping.",
    softSkillsContext: "Soft skills reflect how you work, and they're easiest to believe when they're demonstrated. Cross-functional influence is core in product/design. Show {softSkills[0]} through behaviors: aligning stakeholders, making tradeoffs, synthesizing feedback, and driving a decision to completion.",
    certificationsContext: "Certifications can strengthen your fit when they're common in {category} or explicitly requested in job postings, but they're rarely a substitute for experience. Certs aren't universal in product/design, so only include them if they're recognized in your niche. If certifications aren't typical for {jobTitle}, prioritize portfolio/case-study style bullets that prove your keywords with outcomes.",
    actionVerbsContext: "Strong action verbs help your bullets land because they make your impact obvious at a glance. Start bullets with verbs like {actionVerbs[0]} or {actionVerbs[1]} and follow immediately with *what* you did, *how* you did it, and *what changed* because of it (adoption, conversion, retention, time-to-task).",

      "**Match the role flavor.** Execution-heavy roles want delivery language (backlog grooming, sprints, handoffs). Strategy-heavy roles want discovery and alignment language (problem framing, vision, stakeholder alignment). Choose keywords that match the job's center of gravity."
    ],
    faq: [
      { question: "Should I include a portfolio link on my {jobTitle} resume?", answer: "Absolutely. For product and design roles, a portfolio often matters more than the resume itself. Include a clean, working link near your contact info. Make sure your portfolio loads quickly, works on mobile, and showcases 2-4 of your best case studies with clear problem/process/outcome structure." },
      { question: "How do I show impact when my designs weren't shipped or measured?", answer: "Focus on the process and decisions you drove: 'Led redesign of checkout flow through 3 rounds of user testing, achieving 90% task completion in final prototype.' If the work wasn't shipped, explain why (pivot, acquisition, etc.) and what you learned. Process rigor still demonstrates capability." },
      { question: "What's the right balance between process and outcomes on a {jobTitle} resume?", answer: "Lead with outcomes, support with process. 'Increased activation 25% by redesigning onboarding (user research → prototyping → A/B testing)' is stronger than listing methods without results. Show *that* your process works by showing what it achieved." },
      { question: "How do I handle confidential or NDA-protected work?", answer: "Describe the problem space, your role, and anonymized outcomes: 'Led product strategy for B2B fintech feature serving 50K+ users, improving retention by 15%.' You can discuss process and learnings without revealing proprietary details. Some companies allow case studies with approval, so ask." },
      { question: "Should I list every tool I've used (Figma, Sketch, Miro, etc.)?", answer: "List 5-8 core tools that match the job posting. For design: your primary design tool (Figma/Sketch), prototyping tools, and research/collaboration tools. For product: roadmap tools, analytics, and experimentation platforms. Focus on the ones you'd use daily in the role." }

    ],
    faq: [
      { question: "How do I show marketing impact without revenue access?", answer: "Use the metrics you do have: lead volume, MQL-to-SQL conversion, email open/click rates, engagement rates, traffic growth, cost per lead. Connect these to downstream outcomes when possible: 'Generated 500 MQLs/month, contributing to 40% of sales pipeline.' Ask your sales or finance team for outcome data you can reference." },
      { question: "Should I specialize my resume for a specific marketing channel?", answer: "Yes, if the role is channel-specific (SEO, paid media, email, content). Lead with that channel's keywords and outcomes. For generalist roles, show breadth but still lead with your strongest channel. Having one deep specialty often beats being mediocre at everything." },
      { question: "How do I handle marketing roles at small companies with no formal metrics?", answer: "Estimate reasonable metrics or describe scale: 'Managed $50K/month ad budget across 3 platforms' or 'Grew email list from 5K to 25K subscribers.' Show process rigor: testing, iteration, measurement attempts. Even imperfect data is better than no data." },
      { question: "What marketing certifications actually matter?", answer: "Google Ads, Google Analytics, HubSpot, and Facebook Blueprint are widely recognized and free/cheap. They matter most for entry-level roles or when explicitly requested. For senior roles, results matter more than certs, but certs can help if you're switching channels or industries." },
      { question: "How do I transition into {jobTitle} from a different marketing specialty?", answer: "Highlight transferable skills: campaign management, data analysis, audience targeting, testing methodology. Show curiosity: relevant certifications, side projects, or self-directed learning. Frame your specialty as complementary: 'Applied A/B testing rigor from paid media to email optimization.'" }

Even better, show outcomes: 'Built 3-statement model in Excel that reduced forecast cycle from 2 weeks to 3 days.' Advanced skills (Power Query, VBA) help but aren't always required." },
      { question: "How important are certifications like CPA or CFA for {jobTitle}?", answer: "It depends on the role. CPA is often required or strongly preferred for accounting roles, especially in public accounting or controller tracks. CFA is valued in corporate finance, investment, and FP&A roles. If you're pursuing one, you can list 'CPA Candidate' or 'CFA Level II Candidate.' If you don't have them, emphasize relevant experience and results." }

  "Operations & Admin": {
    intro: "Operations and admin resumes win when they show you can keep the machine running: coordination, accuracy, and continuous improvement. Keywords matter because employers screen for the exact workflows you've owned (scheduling, documentation, vendors, reporting) and the systems you used to run them. Use the sections below to surface those terms and back them with reliability and throughput outcomes.",
    technicalSkillsContext: "Technical skills are the \"must-haves\" that often drive initial screening for {jobTitle} roles. Rather than just listing them, work the most relevant ones (like {technicalSkills[0]}) into bullet points that show the workflow you ran and what improved (cycle time, error rate, SLA).",
    toolsContext: "Tools and technologies help employers quickly picture your day-to-day workflow in {jobTitle}. If you've used {tools.slice(0,3).join(\", \")}, name them in context and describe what you managed with them (tickets, calendars, inventory, records, dashboards). Ops/admin teams often screen by tools because it signals how quickly you can ramp.",
    softSkillsContext: "Soft skills reflect how you work, and they're easiest to believe when they're demonstrated. In operations, soft skills look like dependability and clarity under constraint. Prove {softSkills[0]} by showing you prevented mistakes, handled competing priorities, and kept stakeholders aligned.",
    certificationsContext: "Certifications can strengthen your fit when they're common in {category} or explicitly requested in job postings, but they're rarely a substitute for experience. Certs matter when they map to safety, compliance, or formal process methods. If certifications aren't typical for {jobTitle}, emphasize documented process improvements and measurable reliability instead.",
    actionVerbsContext: "Strong action verbs help your bullets land because they make your impact obvious at a glance. Start bullets with verbs like {actionVerbs[0]} or {actionVerbs[1]} and follow immediately with *what* you did, *how* you did it, and *what changed* (hours saved, errors reduced, backlog cleared).",

      "**Use the right variations without getting cute.** If they emphasize SOPs, audits, or record-keeping, use those exact terms and show how your documentation prevented issues or sped up work."
    ],
    faq: [
      { question: "How do I make administrative work sound impressive on a resume?", answer: "Focus on scale and impact: 'Managed executive calendars across 3 time zones, coordinating 50+ meetings/week with zero conflicts' or 'Reduced invoice processing time 40% by implementing new approval workflow.' Every admin task has a 'how much' and 'how well' dimension. Quantify both." },
      { question: "What if my operations role didn't have formal metrics?", answer: "Estimate reasonable metrics or describe scope and improvements: 'Coordinated office move for 75-person team, completed 2 days ahead of schedule' or 'Managed vendor relationships for $200K annual spend, negotiating 15% cost reduction.' Show that you understand what 'good' looks like in your work." },
      { question: "Should I include software skills like Microsoft Office?", answer: "List specific tools relevant to the role, with context. Instead of 'Microsoft Office,' say 'Advanced Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP)' or 'Created weekly executive reports in PowerPoint.' For operations roles, also highlight specialized tools: project management software, ERP systems, scheduling platforms." },
      { question: "How do I show career growth when I've had the same title for years?", answer: "Highlight expanded responsibilities: 'Grew from supporting 2 executives to managing operations for 15-person department.' Show process improvements you initiated, training you provided, or new systems you implemented. Consistent title doesn't mean stagnant work. Show evolution." },
      { question: "How important is industry experience for {jobTitle} roles?", answer: "It varies. Some operations roles require industry-specific knowledge (healthcare compliance, manufacturing processes). Others value transferable skills: process improvement, vendor management, documentation, coordination. Read the posting carefully. If industry isn't emphasized, focus on demonstrating your operational capabilities." }

  "Healthcare": {
    intro: "In healthcare, keywords aren't buzzwords. They signal patient safety, clinical competence, and compliance. Employers screen for the right mix of care setting terms, patient population, certifications/licenses, and systems like EHR tools. Use the sections below to mirror the unit and responsibilities in the posting, then back each keyword with scope and safe-practice evidence.",
    technicalSkillsContext: "Technical skills are the \"must-haves\" that often drive initial screening for {jobTitle} roles. Clinical skills need to be specific: what you assessed, administered, monitored, documented, or coordinated. If you include {technicalSkills[0]}, add the care context (setting, population, acuity) so the keyword reads as real experience.",
    toolsContext: "Tools and technologies help employers quickly picture your day-to-day workflow in {jobTitle}. If you've used {tools.slice(0,3).join(\", \")}, name them in context and place them near documentation, coordination, or throughput bullets. Healthcare tools (EHR/documentation systems, specialized equipment) are a major screening signal.",
    softSkillsContext: "Soft skills reflect how you work, and they're easiest to believe when they're demonstrated. Soft skills in healthcare are tied to safety and teamwork. Prove {softSkills[0]} via clear handoffs, patient education, interdisciplinary coordination, and calm execution in high-stakes situations.",
    certificationsContext: "Certifications can strengthen your fit when they're common in {category} or explicitly requested in job postings. In healthcare, certifications and licenses are often non-negotiable. List the exact ones the posting requires and keep them easy to find. If certifications aren't typical for {jobTitle}, emphasize supervised clinical hours, training, and setting-specific competencies instead.",
    actionVerbsContext: "Strong action verbs help your bullets land because they make your impact obvious at a glance. Start bullets with verbs like {actionVerbs[0]} or {actionVerbs[1]} and follow immediately with *what* you did, *how* you did it, and scope (patients per shift/caseload) and outcomes where appropriate.",

      "**Prove every keyword with specifics.** Show safe practice through scope + standards. Quantify workload and responsibilities (patients/shift, procedures, documentation timeliness) and mention protocol adherence. If you can't honestly support a term, skip it.",
      "**Make certifications easy to verify.** Place required credentials (and expiration/active status when relevant) where a recruiter can find them in seconds, because many filters start with cert keywords."
    ],
    faq: [
      { question: "How do I list certifications and licenses on my {jobTitle} resume?", answer: "Create a dedicated 'Licenses & Certifications' section near the top. Include: credential name, issuing body, license number (if applicable), and expiration date. For example: 'RN License, State of California #12345, Exp. 12/2025' or 'BLS, American Heart Association, Exp. 06/2024.' Keep required credentials immediately visible." },
      { question: "What if I'm changing healthcare specialties or settings?", answer: "Highlight transferable clinical skills: patient assessment, documentation, care coordination, safety protocols. Show adaptability: 'Transitioned from med-surg to ICU, achieving independent practice within 3-month orientation.' Emphasize any cross-training, floating experience, or relevant certifications for the new specialty." },
      { question: "How do I show patient care quality without sharing protected information?", answer: "Use aggregated or anonymized metrics: 'Maintained 98% patient satisfaction scores' or 'Zero medication errors over 2-year period.' Describe process adherence: 'Consistently met documentation standards within 2-hour window.' You can discuss outcomes without identifying individual patients." },
      { question: "Should I include every EHR system I've used?", answer: "List the systems most relevant to the role, especially if they match the posting. Major systems (Epic, Cerner, Meditech) are worth highlighting. If you've used the specific system the employer uses, make it prominent. For less common systems, focus on demonstrating you can learn new platforms quickly." },
      { question: "How important is the care setting match for {jobTitle} applications?", answer: "Very important for many healthcare roles. ICU experience signals different competencies than outpatient clinic experience. If your setting matches, emphasize it. If it doesn't, highlight transferable skills and any exposure to the target setting (floating, cross-training, clinical rotations). Be honest about your experience level." }

If you've used {tools.slice(0,3).join(\", \")}, name them in context and clarify whether it was ATS workflow, HRIS reporting, scheduling, or benefits administration, plus what improved. Tools are heavily weighted because they predict ramp time.",

Show quality: 'Hired 15 engineers, 90% retention at 1 year.' Describe sourcing strategies: 'Built diverse pipeline through targeted outreach, increasing underrepresented candidates 40%.'" },
      { question: "Should I list every ATS and HRIS I've used?", answer: "Focus on systems relevant to the role or mentioned in the posting.

For each system, briefly describe what you did with it: 'Managed full-cycle recruiting workflow in Greenhouse for 50+ requisitions annually.'" },
      { question: "How do I transition from recruiting to HR generalist (or vice versa)?", answer: "Highlight overlapping skills: onboarding, employee relations, compliance awareness, HRIS.
