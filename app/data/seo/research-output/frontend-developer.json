    "roleIntroModule": "**{jobTitle}** (sometimes called Front-end Engineer or UI Developer) is the developer in charge of the user-facing part of web applications. This role involves translating design mockups into interactive, **responsive** webpages. For example, one job template notes that a Frontend Developer “requires expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend frameworks (React)” ([www.medlibra.com](https://www.medlibra.com/frontend/job-description#:~:text=Job%20Description)). Typical deliverables include reusable component libraries (style guides), dynamic page layouts, and performance-optimized user interfaces. Recruiters filter for core skills like **{technicalSkills.slice(0,3).join(\", \")}** (and related frameworks and tools), so showcase concrete projects or portfolios that prove these abilities.",
    "skillsContextModule": "When listing your technical skills, back each one with evidence from your work. If you include **{technicalSkills[2]}** or **{technicalSkills[0]}**, tie them to projects (e.g. ‘Developed a React component library’). For **{technicalSkills[6]}** (Redux) or **{technicalSkills[7]}** (REST/GraphQL), describe how you managed state or integrated APIs. Always quantify the impact: for example, “Optimized rendering performance, reducing load time by X%.” Showing outcomes (like performance gains or error reductions) proves your mastery of each front-end skill.",
    "toolsContextModule": "Front-end work also relies on specific tools. If you list **{tools[0]}** or **{tools[3]}**, mention how you used them (e.g. bundling with Webpack to speed up builds). For **Git**, note your experience collaborating via branches and pull requests. Highlight testing tools like **{tools[5]}** (Cypress) or **{tools[4]}** (Jest) by describing your test coverage or stability improvements. Include design/prototyping tools (e.g. **{tools[6]}**) if you converted mockups to code. Linking each tool to concrete tasks (for example, “used Figma to implement design specs”) shows you know the full front-end development workflow.",
    "softSkillsContextModule": "Even a technical role like Frontend Developer requires strong collaboration. Use your resume to show how you worked with others. For instance, describe leading discussions with designers to refine a UI or partnering with QA on cross-browser fixes. Emphasize communication by noting client or team interactions that improved the product. Highlight problem-solving by mentioning a tricky bug you helped fix or a performance issue you resolved. Demonstrating **teamwork** and empathy (for example, “gathered user feedback to inform UI changes”) proves you can work effectively in a product team.",
    "certsContextModule": "Certifications are rarely mandatory for front-end roles. Employers prioritize hands-on experience and a solid portfolio ([www.medlibra.com](https://www.medlibra.com/frontend/job-description#:~:text=solving%20skills.%20,science%20or%20relevant%20industry%20experience)). Include a certification only if it directly matches the job requirements (for example, a cloud cert if the role involves AWS-hosted SPAs, or a UX cert if the job emphasizes user experience). Otherwise, focus on demonstrable skills (projects, contributions, open source work) rather than listing generic certificates. A well-documented project or a live demo usually speaks louder than a credential in front-end development.",
    "actionVerbsContextModule": "Start each bullet with a strong action verb and tie it to a clear result. For example, you might write **Optimized** page load time by 30% or **Refactored** code to reduce bugs. Front-end metrics to quantify include load times, API error rates, or user engagement; always follow verbs like **Optimized** or **Reduced** with specific outcomes. Using verbs like **Implemented**, **Designed**, **Deployed**, etc., reminds the reader of your role in the action. In short, pair each {actionVerbs[2]}/**{actionVerbs[3]}** with measurable improvements (e.g. speed-ups, accuracy gains).",
    "exampleBulletsContextModule": "Your resume bullets should follow the pattern: Action → Skill/Tool → Outcome. Apply this to the {jobTitle} context by, for example, writing “Optimized React application load time by 30%” rather than just listing technologies. Each crucial keyword should be in a sentence that shows what you did with it. For instance, instead of a generic line of terms like “React, CSS, Agile”, craft a sentence like “**{actionVerbs[2]}** a React web app bundle size by 40%, improving startup time.” This way each {technicalSkills[2]} (React) mention is backed by a real accomplishment, preventing keyword stuffing and showing real impact."
  },
  "howToUseModules": [
    "Scan the job posting for the most frequently mentioned terms and prioritize them on your resume. Keywords that repeat (like specific frameworks or tasks) are usually critical. For example, if the posting cites **{technicalSkills[2]}**, **{technicalSkills[1]}**, or a particular tool several times, weave those terms into your top skills section and bullets early on. This ensures the resume aligns with what the employer is looking for.",
    "Understand which keywords are non-negotiable versus those that add credibility. \"Hard filter\" keywords are those required skills (for example: **{technicalSkills[0]}**, **{technicalSkills[2]}**, or a specific framework listed under requirements), so highlight them prominently. Other keywords (like web accessibility or Agile) may boost credibility but are often nice-to-haves. Use the context: if a skill is listed in the main qualifications, treat it as essential.",
    "Map keywords directly to your resume achievements. If the job description mentions **responsive design**, include a bullet about building mobile-friendly interfaces. If it says **GraphQL**, highlight a project where you integrated GraphQL APIs. For instance, if it emphasizes {technicalSkills[7]}, you could write a small example sentence like “Integrated GraphQL endpoints, reducing data-fetch code by half.” Relate each required keyword to a concrete example from your experience.",
    "Use synonyms and acronyms wisely. If a posting uses an acronym (e.g. WCAG for accessibility), mention both terms on your resume. Avoid listing the same concept twice under different names. For example, saying 'HTTP RESTful APIs (REST)' covers both styles. Use consistent capitalization and common spellings so that the ATS matches your keywords correctly.",
    "Format your resume for ATS readability. Stick to plain text sections with standard headings (Skills, Experience, Education). Avoid tables, images, or unusual layouts that ATS software may skip over. List keywords in context rather than hidden in images or charts. Also, submit in the requested file format (often a simple PDF or DOC) so the ATS can parse it correctly.",
    "Match your resume to the specific sub-specialty or domain. Frontend roles can vary (e.g. React developer vs. UI designer focus). If applying to a React-heavy role, prioritize React/Redux experience. If it’s a design-centric front-end job, emphasize UI/UX skills and Figma. Tailor your keywords to that lane – don’t plaster every possible skill if it doesn’t fit (e.g. leave out backend-only tech for a pure front-end role)."

  "faqModules": [
    {
      "question": "What are the most important technical skills to list for a Frontend Developer?",
      "answer": "Core web technologies should top your list. Employers expect HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript as the foundation. Most postings also require at least one modern framework (React, Angular or Vue) and often TypeScript ([www.medlibra.com](https://www.medlibra.com/frontend/job-description#:~:text=Job%20Description)). Include state management libraries (Redux/MobX), REST or GraphQL APIs, and build tools (Webpack, npm) if they show up in the job description. These are “hard” skills: you need them to pass initial filters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it necessary to have certifications for a Frontend Developer role?",
      "answer": "Certifications are generally optional for front-end positions. Most hiring managers care more about practical experience, portfolios or projects. Guides often emphasize a strong web development portfolio over formal training ([www.medlibra.com](https://www.medlibra.com/frontend/job-description#:~:text=solving%20skills.%20,science%20or%20relevant%20industry%20experience)). If you do list a cert, make sure it’s directly relevant (for example, an AWS cert if the job involves AWS-hosted frontends). Otherwise, focus on demonstrating skills through real work rather than certificates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I include design or UI/UX tools on my Frontend resume?",
      "answer": "Frontend developers frequently collaborate with designers, so mentioning relevant tools can help. If you’ve used Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to translate designs, include it. However, remember the core of your resume is coding skills. As one guide notes, a frontend developer “codes [components] with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript” and usually works with designers ([careerfoundry.com](https://careerfoundry.com/blog/web-development/frontend-developer-skills#:~:text=A%20frontend%20developer%20codes%20those,complete%20website%20or%20web%20application)). Prioritize coding frameworks and languages, but feel free to list UI/UX tools under “Technologies” if you have that experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some alternate job titles similar to Frontend Developer?",
      "answer": "This role goes by a few names. You’ll often see **Frontend Engineer**, **UI Developer**, **Web Developer**, or even **JavaScript Developer** in postings ([careerfoundry.com](https://careerfoundry.com/blog/web-development/frontend-developer-skills#:~:text=,CSS%2FHTML%20Developer)). The responsibilities overlap a lot, so if you have experience in one, you can safely target any of these titles. Just tailor your keywords: e.g. if applying to a “Frontend Engineer” role, emphasize engineering terms (React, performance, testing) in your resume."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is it to include metrics or numbers in frontend resume bullets?",
      "answer": "Quantifiable results make your frontend achievements stand out. Including metrics in multiple bullets is recommended ([www.beamjobs.com](https://www.beamjobs.com/resumes/front-end-developer-resume-samples#:~:text=,those%20impacts%20are%20rough%20estimates)). For example, note percentage improvements in load times, reductions in bug counts, or user engagement gains. Instead of “Improved page speed”, say “**Improved page load speed by 40%**.” Numbers give recruiters a concrete idea of your impact and align your skills with business outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What keywords or phrases should I avoid on a Frontend resume?",
      "answer": "Avoid buzzwords or irrelevant skills that don’t match the role. For a frontend position, too much emphasis on backend or unrelated tech (like talking about databases, server clustering, or non-web frameworks) can trigger red flags. Generic terms like “JavaScript ninja” or simply listing vague traits don’t help. In fact, many resumes get filtered out for **missing** key terms (like React or TypeScript) ([www.resumeadapter.com](https://www.resumeadapter.com/blog/frontend-developer-resume-keywords#:~:text=%3E%2075,frameworks%2C%20and%20responsive%20design%20keywords)), so focus on relevant keywords instead. Stick to actual technologies and outcomes."
