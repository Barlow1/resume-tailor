						title: 'Fullstack Software Engineer (L5) - Resilience Engineering',
						content: `It‚Äôs an amazing time to be joining Netflix as we continue to transform entertainment. We deliver billions of hours of movies and TV shows per month to more than 230 million members in over 190 countries. At Netflix, we want to entertain the world. To achieve this, we must be able to rapidly build and ship innovative experiences for our members and creators all around the globe.

							Who we are
							Resilience Engineering‚Äôs purpose is to help other teams at Netflix understand the outcome of a change before it reaches production, for example, a code change introduced to their application. Our platform and tools are leveraged by many of the most critical services at Netflix to confidently and safely deliver changes to those services to production.
							
							We enable teams to gain confidence in a change and understand whether that change is having the intended outcome and working as expected.  We also help them tell if that change is having unintended consequences that would negatively impact Netflix‚Äôs users (for example increasing error rates or latency).
							
							A major way we do so is by running a ‚Äòcanary‚Äô. A canary is an experiment where we compare operational metrics between two versions of a service to detect if a change would negatively impact customers. It can also help determine if a change had its intended effect. For example, if you expected a change to reduce latency, did it actually accomplish that?
							
							Our platform is also responsible for Chaos at Netflix. Chaos is leveraged by services to understand what happens in different failure scenarios. This enables services to answer questions like ‚Äúwhat happens if latency or errors increase dramatically between a service and its dependency?‚Äù.
							
							You can learn a lot more about what we do from these presentations:
							- Evolution of Chaos
							- Infrastructure Experimentation
							- Sticky Canaries
							
							Where we work
							We are a distributed team. We have folks both near the office and who are remote. While some folks are near the office, we work as a remote team. We do get together in person about once a quarter.
							
							What you could work on
							A major focus of 2023 is to be able to confidently and safely deliver changes across the fleet of applications at Netflix.
							
							Some of the larger initiatives we will be focusing on are:
							- Building the system that validates changes across the Netflix fleet
							- Developing new approaches to more confidently assess whether a change causes negative impacts
							- Improving our existing validations so there are fewer false positives
							About you
							Full Stack ‚Äì You would consider yourself a full stack developer and have several years experience both frontend and backend development with 4+ years of experience
							React ‚Äì You are proficient in working with React
							Distributed Systems - You have experience working with high scale distributed systems and how to debug them/how they can fail
							You have worked on an internal infrastructure or platform team where other engineers at the company were your customers
							You enjoy collaborating with multiple teams and use your communication skills to influence product direction.
							You are curious and enjoy working on ambiguous problems where the solutions are not (yet) well defined
							Our culture is unique, and we tend to live by our values, allowing you to do your best work and grow. To learn more about Productivity Engineering, feel free to listen to this podcast.
							
							We are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
							
							At Netflix, we carefully consider a wide range of compensation factors to determine your personal top of market. We rely on market indicators to determine compensation and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to get it right. These considerations can cause your compensation to vary and will also be dependent on your location.
							
							The overall market range for roles in this area of Netflix is typically $100,000 - $700,000.
							
							This market range is based on total compensation (vs. only base salary), which is in line with our compensation philosophy. Netflix is a unique culture and environment. Learn more here.`,
