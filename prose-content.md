## SALES_AND_BUSINESS

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Sales and business resumes get filtered on proof: revenue impact, pipeline creation, and repeatable execution. ATS and recruiters still look for the same language from the job description—sales motions, tools, and market terms—so your resume needs those keywords *and* the numbers that validate them. Use the sections below to mirror the role’s funnel and make it obvious what you can own in your first 30–60 days."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Treat these as funnel skills, not buzzwords. If a posting emphasizes {technicalSkills[0]} or {technicalSkills[1]}, place them inside bullets that show *where* in the cycle you used them (prospecting → discovery → closing → expansion) and what moved (pipeline $, win rate, cycle time)."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Sales orgs often screen by stack because it predicts ramp time. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, tie each tool to a workflow (sequencing, qualification notes, forecasting, account plans)—not just a tools list."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"In revenue roles, soft skills show up as execution under pressure: handling objections, influencing stakeholders, and staying organized across deals. Prove {softSkills[0]} with a concrete behavior (multi-threading, crisp follow-up cadence, clean handoffs)."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certifications can help when they match an industry or methodology the company cares about, but they’re secondary to performance. If certifications are N/A for {jobTitle}, prioritize deal stories and metrics."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal ownership and movement—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, negotiated, expanded, renewed—then attach a metric (quota %, pipeline created, ARR influenced, retention)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they pair keywords (tools + sales motions) with outcomes (revenue, pipeline, retention). Use them as a pattern: motion → tool → metric."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Map keywords to the funnel stage.** “Prospecting,” “discovery,” “MEDDIC,” “forecasting,” and “expansion” mean different things to different teams. Put the keyword next to the stage you owned so ATS matches *and* a recruiter immediately understands your fit."

"**Quantify without breaking confidentiality.** If you can’t share exact dollars, use percentages, rankings, or deltas (e.g., 120% of quota, +35% territory growth, top 10% of team). The keyword is the method; the metric is the proof."

"**Mirror the posting’s wording.** If they say “pipeline generation,” don’t only say “lead gen.” If they say “renewals,” don’t only say “customer success.” Exact phrasing improves ATS matching and makes your resume feel tailored."

"**Choose keywords you can defend on a call.** Pick the top terms you can back up with real examples, then repeat them naturally across Summary, Skills, and Experience—without stuffing."
([Indeed][1])

## PRODUCT_AND_DESIGN

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Product and design hiring teams scan for two things fast: how you make decisions and what changed because of them. Your keywords should reflect the lifecycle—discovery, prioritization, delivery, and measurement—so ATS can match you and humans can trust you. Use the sections below to surface the methods, tools, and outcomes you’ve actually shipped."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These are your craft skills: discovery and synthesis, prioritization, and execution. If {technicalSkills[0]} is relevant, place it in a bullet that shows the decision you made, the constraint you navigated, and the user/business impact."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Tools signal how you collaborate and deliver. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, connect each to an artifact (PRD, roadmap, prototype, research synthesis, experiment readout) so it reads like evidence—not name-dropping."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Cross-functional influence is core in product/design. Show {softSkills[0]} through behaviors: aligning stakeholders, making tradeoffs, synthesizing feedback, and driving a decision to completion."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certifications aren’t universal in product/design, so only include them if they’re recognized in your niche or requested. If certs are N/A, prioritize portfolio/case-study style bullets that prove your keywords with outcomes."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal ownership and decision-making—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, prioritized, validated, shipped—then follow with the metric you moved (adoption, conversion, retention, time-to-task)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These examples work because they connect artifacts (roadmaps, prototypes, experiments) to impact. Treat the keyword as the method—then show the result that justified it."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Anchor keywords to artifacts people recognize.** Product roles look for terms like roadmap, PRD, OKRs, A/B testing; design roles look for wireframes, prototyping, usability testing, design systems. Put the keyword next to the thing you produced or led."

"**Pair every keyword with an outcome.** “User research” is stronger as “ran user research that reduced drop-off by X%” or “validated onboarding redesign, improving activation.” Even qualitative work can be specific (fewer support tickets, faster task completion)."

"**Match the role flavor.** Execution-heavy roles want delivery language (backlog grooming, sprints, handoffs). Strategy-heavy roles want discovery and alignment language (problem framing, vision, stakeholder alignment). Choose keywords that match the job’s center of gravity."

"**Make the top terms easy to find—then prove them.** Put your top 5–8 keywords in Summary/Skills, then substantiate them in Experience bullets. ATS finds terms; humans believe evidence."
([ResumeAdapter][2])

## OPERATIONS_AND_ADMIN

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Operations and admin resumes win when they show you can keep the machine running: coordination, accuracy, and continuous improvement. Keywords matter because employers screen for the exact workflows you’ve owned (scheduling, documentation, vendors, reporting) and the systems you used to run them. Use the sections below to surface those terms—and back them with reliability and throughput outcomes."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These are the operational competencies behind smooth execution: process management, documentation, logistics, compliance, reporting. Feature {technicalSkills[0]} in bullets that show the workflow you ran and what improved (cycle time, error rate, SLA)."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Ops/admin teams often screen by tools because it signals how quickly you can ramp. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, describe what you managed with them (tickets, calendars, inventory, records, dashboards)."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"In operations, soft skills look like dependability and clarity under constraint. Prove {softSkills[0]} by showing you prevented mistakes, handled competing priorities, and kept stakeholders aligned."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certifications matter when they map to safety, compliance, or formal process methods—and when the posting asks for them. If certs are N/A for {jobTitle}, emphasize documented process improvements and measurable reliability instead."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal control and improvement—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, streamlined, coordinated—then quantify the result (hours saved, errors reduced, backlog cleared)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they connect operational keywords to outcomes: smoother handoffs, fewer incidents, faster turnaround. In ops, “process” is a deliverable—show the before/after."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Translate keywords into the work you actually run.** “Calendar management” means whose calendars, how many stakeholders, and what cadence. “Process improvement” means what bottleneck, what changed, and what metric moved."

"**Prioritize accuracy + throughput indicators.** Ops/admin hiring values reliability: turnaround time, SLA adherence, error rate, rework reduced, cost/time saved. Even if you don’t have perfect metrics, quantify scope (per day/week/month) consistently."

"**Mirror the posting’s compliance/documentation language.** If they emphasize SOPs, audits, or record-keeping, use those exact terms and show how your documentation prevented issues or sped up work."

"**Keep structure ATS-clean.** Standard headings and simple bullets help parsing and make your impact skimmable."
([Indeed][3])

## MARKETING

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Marketing resumes get filtered on two things: channel fit (SEO, paid, email, lifecycle, content, etc.) and measurable impact (pipeline, revenue, CAC, conversion). Keywords matter because ATS and recruiters search for the exact channels, platforms, and metrics in the posting. Use the sections below to match that language—then prove each term with a before/after result."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These skills signal how you drive growth: strategy plus execution. If you list {technicalSkills[0]} or {technicalSkills[1]}, connect them to outcomes like conversion rate, ROAS, CAC, MQL quality, retention, or engagement."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Marketing stacks vary, so tool keywords are often a screening shortcut. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, say what you did with them (tracking, attribution, automation, experimentation) and what improved."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Marketing is cross-functional by default—sales, product, brand, creative. Prove {softSkills[0]} through clear briefs, tight stakeholder alignment, fast iteration, and learning loops from experiments."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certs can help when they’re platform-specific (ads, analytics, automation), but they’re optional in many marketing roles. If certifications are N/A, prioritize a case-study style bullet with clean metrics and links to outcomes if possible."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that imply growth work—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, launched, tested, scaled—then attach the metric (CTR, CVR, CAC, ROAS, revenue influenced)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they combine channel keywords with proof: what you shipped, how you measured, and what moved. Marketing keywords only ‘count’ when your results make them credible."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Match keywords to the channel mix.** If the role is demand gen, emphasize pipeline and conversion terms. If it’s lifecycle, emphasize segmentation, automation, churn/retention. If it’s SEO/content, emphasize research, optimization, and performance metrics."

"**Use the metrics marketers are judged on.** Recruiters scan for outcomes like pipeline influenced, CAC, conversion rate, retention, and ROAS. Put at least one hard number in most bullets—even if it’s a directional improvement."

"**Show you understand measurement.** Mention tracking, reporting, attribution, and experimentation only if you can explain how you measured success. That’s where ATS keywords turn into trust."

"**Avoid vague work statements.** “Managed campaigns” is weak; “grew sign-ups by X% by optimizing {tools[0]} targeting + creative tests” is strong. Make the keyword the method, and the metric the proof."
([ProRes.ai][4])

## HEALTHCARE

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"In healthcare, keywords aren’t buzzwords—they signal patient safety, clinical competence, and compliance. Employers screen for the right mix of care setting terms, patient population, certifications/licenses, and systems like EHR tools. Use the sections below to mirror the unit and responsibilities in the posting, then back each keyword with scope and safe-practice evidence."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Clinical skills need to be specific: what you assessed, administered, monitored, documented, or coordinated. If you include {technicalSkills[0]}, add the care context (setting, population, acuity) so the keyword reads as real experience."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Healthcare tools often include EHR/documentation systems and specialized equipment—and they’re a major screening signal. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, place them near documentation, coordination, or throughput bullets."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Soft skills in healthcare are tied to safety and teamwork. Prove {softSkills[0]} via clear handoffs, patient education, interdisciplinary coordination, and calm execution in high-stakes situations."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certifications and licenses are often non-negotiable, so list the exact ones the posting requires and keep them easy to find. If certifications are N/A for {jobTitle}, emphasize supervised clinical hours, training, and setting-specific competencies instead."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that reflect safe clinical action—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, administered, monitored, documented, educated, coordinated—then add scope (patients per shift/caseload) and outcomes where appropriate."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they connect clinical keywords to evidence: setting + responsibility + result. In healthcare, specificity builds trust faster than flashy wording."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Match keywords to setting + population.** “Acute care” vs “outpatient,” pediatrics vs geriatrics, med-surg vs ICU—these are high-impact terms. Mirror the posting’s setting language and show you’ve worked in that environment."

"**Make certifications easy to verify.** Place required credentials (and expiration/active status when relevant) where a recruiter can find them in seconds, because many filters start with cert keywords."

"**Show safe practice through scope + standards.** Even when you can’t share sensitive data, you can quantify workload and responsibilities (patients/shift, procedures, documentation timeliness) and mention protocol adherence."

"**Keep formatting clean for ATS and clinical review.** Use standard headings and consistent terminology that matches the posting."
([Indeed][1])

## HR_AND_RECRUITING

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"HR and recruiting resumes are screened for two buckets of keywords: the processes you run (full-cycle recruiting, onboarding, ER, benefits, compliance) and the systems you run them in (ATS/HRIS). Your resume should make it obvious which lane you own, because those keywords drive initial filtering. Use the sections below to match the posting, then prove each keyword with throughput, quality, or compliance outcomes."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These skills show what you actually own: sourcing, screening, interviewing, onboarding, employee relations, compliance, reporting. If you mention {technicalSkills[0]}, add scope (roles filled, headcount supported, locations) and the result."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Tools are heavily weighted because they predict ramp time. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, clarify whether it was ATS workflow, HRIS reporting, scheduling, or benefits administration—and what improved."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Trust and communication are the job. Prove {softSkills[0]} through stakeholder management (hiring managers, leaders, candidates), structured processes, and handling sensitive situations professionally."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certifications can help in HR—especially for compliance-heavy roles—but they’re not universal. If certifications are N/A for {jobTitle}, don’t pad; prioritize measurable HR/TA outcomes instead."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal ownership and throughput—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, sourced, screened, onboarded, implemented, resolved—and attach metrics (time-to-fill, offer acceptance, retention, compliance results)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These examples work because they pair HR keywords with proof: system used + process owned + measurable outcome. That’s exactly how hiring teams validate keywords."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Match your keywords to the HR/TA lane.** Recruiting-heavy jobs want sourcing, pipeline, Boolean search, ATS stages; HR-generalist jobs want ER, compliance, performance management, HRIS reporting. Don’t mix lanes unless the role truly spans both."

"**Name the system *and* the workflow.** “Used {tools[0]}” is weak; “managed interview loops and offer approvals in {tools[0]}” is strong. Systems keywords matter most when connected to real work."

"**Quantify outcomes HR teams care about.** Recruiting: time-to-fill, funnel conversion, offer acceptance, cost-per-hire. HR: headcount supported, case resolution time, training completion, audit readiness."

"**Use keyword variations recruiters search—and only if you can defend them.** “Boolean search,” “DEI sourcing,” or “compensation bands” are credibility tests. Pick the terms you can explain with real examples."
([AIHR][5])

## FINANCE_AND_ACCOUNTING

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Finance and accounting resumes are screened for precision: core processes (close, reporting, forecasting), standards/compliance (GAAP/SOX/IFRS where relevant), and the systems you used to execute them. Keywords matter because they signal what you can own on day one—but they only help if your bullets prove accuracy, speed, and decision impact. Use the sections below to match the posting and make your ownership obvious."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These are the core responsibilities hiring teams search for: reconciliations, reporting, forecasting, variance analysis, audit support, controls. If you list {technicalSkills[0]}, add cadence and scope (monthly close, #entities, accounts owned) plus a result (faster close, fewer adjustments)."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Tool keywords are common filters because they predict ramp time. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, attach them to outputs: models, JE support, reconciliations, dashboards, forecasts."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Soft skills here translate to trust: rigor, clarity, and stakeholder communication. Prove {softSkills[0]} with examples of explaining variance drivers, partnering with operators, or improving controls without slowing the business."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certs can be a strong signal for some finance/accounting roles, but they don’t replace experience. If certifications are N/A for {jobTitle}, emphasize audit-ready documentation, clean models, and process improvements."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal ownership—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, reconciled, forecasted, reported, automated—then quantify impact (close reduced by X days, errors reduced, variance explained)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they connect finance keywords to business value: accuracy + speed + decision-making. In this field, the keyword is the process—your proof is the control and the outcome."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Mirror the posting’s lane.** Accounting roles often emphasize month-end close, GL, reconciliations, compliance; finance roles emphasize forecasting, modeling, KPIs, variance. Make sure your top keywords reflect the lane you’re applying for."

"**Quantify scope and cadence.** Add the “how much/how often” details that turn keywords into ownership: #entities, budget size, forecast horizon, close cycle length, account volume."

"**Show control-minded improvements.** Automation keywords are strongest when paired with accuracy safeguards (validation checks, reconciliations, review steps) and measurable time/error reduction."

"**Use consistent terminology.** If the posting uses GAAP, SOX, IFRS, FP&A, or “month-end close,” match that wording so ATS searches and hiring manager scans line up."
([VisualCV][6])

## ENGINEERING

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Engineering resumes get filtered for evidence you can build, ship, and operate real systems. Keywords matter because ATS and hiring managers search for specific languages, architecture terms, and tooling—but you stand out by proving impact (performance, reliability, scale, delivery). Use the sections below to match the job’s stack and responsibilities, then show what you built and what improved."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These are your credibility signals. If you list {technicalSkills[0]} or {technicalSkills[1]}, tie them to a shipped system: what you designed, how you tested it, and what metric moved (latency, uptime, cost, throughput)."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Tools tell the story of how you deliver: version control, CI/CD, cloud, deployment, monitoring. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, place them next to the lifecycle step they supported (build, deploy, observe, debug)."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"Soft skills are how engineers scale impact: collaboration, ownership, and clear communication. Prove {softSkills[0]} via cross-team delivery, reviews, incident response, or mentoring."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certs can help in some engineering niches (cloud/security), but they’re optional for many teams. If certifications are N/A, prioritize shipped work, architecture decisions, and measurable improvements."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal real engineering—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, built, scaled, refactored, automated—then quantify outcomes (p95 latency, error rate, deploy frequency, infra cost)."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they connect tech keywords to a system and a measurable result. That’s the fastest way to make keywords believable to an engineer reviewer."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Pick keywords that match the team’s stack and problems.** Don’t shotgun every language. Mirror the posting’s core stack and domain terms so ATS matches and the hiring manager sees fit immediately."

"**Prove each keyword with a constraint + result.** Strong engineering bullets include: what you built, the constraint (scale, reliability, latency), and a measurable before/after. That’s what turns “{technicalSkills[0]}” into credibility."

"**Show end-to-end delivery signals.** Many teams screen for “can ship” keywords: code reviews, CI/CD, testing, monitoring, and on-call/incident response. Place those terms where you describe releases and production ownership."

"**Keep formatting ATS-friendly.** Standard headings and simple bullets help parsing and scanning."
([VisualCV][7])

---

## DATA_AND_ANALYTICS

INTRO_PARAGRAPH:
"Data and analytics resumes are screened for a tight loop: ask the right question, build the right dataset, and drive a decision. Keywords matter because recruiters filter on tools (SQL/BI), techniques (cleaning, modeling, experimentation), and business context (funnels, cohorts, forecasting). Use the sections below to match the posting, then prove each keyword by showing the decision or metric it changed."

TECHNICAL_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"These skills are your analysis engine: querying, cleaning, modeling, visualization, experimentation, reporting. If you list {technicalSkills[0]}, show the dataset/workflow you used and what the analysis enabled (faster decisions, better conversion, reduced churn)."

TOOLS_CONTEXT:
"Tool keywords are often hard filters in analytics hiring. If you’ve used {tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}, connect them to deliverables: dashboards, ETL jobs, experiment readouts, stakeholder reports."

SOFT_SKILLS_CONTEXT:
"In analytics, soft skills equal influence. Prove {softSkills[0]} by showing how you partnered with stakeholders and turned findings into a shipped change."

CERTIFICATIONS_CONTEXT:
"Certifications can help for entry-level credibility or platform-specific roles, but they’re optional for many teams. If certifications are N/A, your best substitute is a clear project story with SQL/BI keywords and a measurable outcome."

ACTION_VERBS_CONTEXT:
"Use verbs that signal analysis-to-action—{actionVerbs[0]}, {actionVerbs[1]}, analyzed, modeled, validated, instrumented, automated—then name the decision or metric impacted."

EXAMPLE_BULLETS_CONTEXT:
"These bullets work because they connect technical keywords to business outcomes: what question you answered, how you answered it, and what changed."

HOW_TO_USE_SECTION:
"**Write bullets as ‘question → method → result.’** Example structure: investigated X, used {technicalSkills[0]}/{tools[0]} to do Y, drove Z outcome. This makes keywords meaningful and interview-ready."

"**Highlight data quality and definitions.** Hiring teams look for cleaning, validation, KPI definitions, and monitoring because unreliable data breaks decisions. If you built pipelines, mention checks and stakeholders’ metric alignment."

"**Match the lane: BI vs product analytics vs DS.** BI prizes dashboards and reporting; product analytics prizes funnels and experimentation; DS prizes modeling. Choose keywords that align with the lane and show one strong example per lane you claim."

"**Make tools discoverable—then prove them.** Put top tools in Skills, then reuse them naturally inside Experience bullets that describe dashboards, pipelines, or experiments."
([VisualCV][8])

### Implementation edge cases to handle (so these templates don’t break)

* **Certifications are `["N/A"]`, empty, or uncommon by category:** hide the whole Certifications section (or swap the heading to “Training” for categories like Marketing/Product/Design/Sales where certs are optional). ([Indeed][1])
* **Arrays shorter than expected:** avoid hard-referencing `{actionVerbs[1]}` etc. unless you guard length; prefer safe patterns like `{tools.slice(0,3).join(", ")}`.
* **Category contains multiple “lanes”:** Product & Design (PM vs UX), Finance & Accounting (FP&A vs GL), Data & Analytics (BI vs DS). If you can tag subtypes later, you can split each category template into two variants for even higher relevance.
* **ATS formatting pitfalls:** keep headings standard (“Skills,” “Experience,” “Education”), avoid complex layouts, and mirror job-description phrasing/spelling (acronyms vs full terms). ([Indeed][9])
